    <h1>How I Built This Page</h1>
  <br>
    The first I did was create a javascript server for my html file. What the server does is it takes in a username that is type by the visiter. It is an backend-Framework the that uses javascripts. The difficult part of this was learning how to code in javascript, but since I have a good background in JAVA, it did not take me long to learn enough. 
  </br> <br>The next step was to download the required frameworks using the terminal. which was fairly simple</br> 
  <br>The final step, not including making he html file was setting the server up on GitHub</br>
